# Simon Game

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Simon Game using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game features a series of flashing colors that the player must replicate in the correct sequence.

## How It Works

Simon Game is a memory game where the player has to follow a sequence of colors and sounds that are played by the game. The sequence starts with one color and gets progressively longer with each successful round. The goal is to repeat the sequence correctly to advance to the next level.

### Game Play

1. **Sequence Generation**: The game generates a sequence of colors that flashes on the screen.
2. **Player Input**: The player must click on the colored buttons in the same order as shown in the sequence.
3. **Sequence Validation**: If the player's sequence matches the generated sequence, the game progresses to the next round with an extended sequence. If the player makes a mistake, the game ends, and the sequence is reset.
4. **Sound Effects**: Each color has a corresponding sound effect that plays when the color is shown or clicked.

## Features

- **Color Buttons**: Four buttons with different colors.
- **Sound Effects**: Each button plays a unique sound when activated.
- **Sequence Display**: Flashing sequence of colors that the player must follow.
- **Score Tracking**: Displays the current level or score of the game.
